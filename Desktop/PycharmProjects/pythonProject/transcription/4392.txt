how can the universal set be represented using the Venn diagram consider an example in the list form the universal set consists of1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 set a consists of 14 and 5 Set B consists of 215 and 7 set A and B are proper subsets of the universal set first let us represent the sets A and B using the Venn diagrams to do that we seeI have any common elements both the sets have the numbers 1 AND 5 in them it means that these sets over a and will look something like this the element one exist in both the sides we write it here in the overlapping Region 4 exist only in a which is why we write it in this region 5 exist in both thecan we write it where A and B overlap two is present only in b and we write it in this region 1 AND 5 already exist 7 is also present on in b and we write it here so we have successfully Drawn The Venn diagram for sets A and B but where is the universal set think about it sincesubsets of the universal set we should know that both t-shirts will lie inside the universal set and the universal set is represented using a rectangle this is the universal set and we can see that it contains all the numbers present in a and b but also note that the universal set has three and six as its elementsand these elements are neither included in a normal B so they are written outside the two sets but within the universal set 3 and 6 can be written here now the picture is clear the universal set has all the elements 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 now I will ask you iflet's ignore the list form and just look at the Venn diagram you just have to think of the answer and there's absolutely no need to write them down which are the numbers that are present in a and b this basically means that the numbers have to be present in both A and B it means we are talking about this overlapping regionand the numbers are 1 AND 5 and this is written as a intersection b symbolically it's an inverted you it is called intersection because it covers the part that is the intersection of overlap of set A and B ok the next question which are the elements that are and B but not in a weabout this blue region which excludes everything from a so 2 and 7 are the elements that are and B but not in a and mathematically it is written as B minus A minus A since when not including the elements in a the next question is a bit tricky which are the elements that are in a or baob means it can be insert a or Set B or in both A and B it means it has to be in at least one of the sets it will include all elements in this green region so the elements in a or b will be 4152 and 7 that isit is the union of all elements in a and b without repetition 3 and 6 were not included as their outside A and B here is a simple question which are the elements in a it will be all the elements in this blue circular region so the elements are 41 and 5similarly which are the elements in b which will be this brown circular region so 152 and 7 are the elements in b and this is written as Set B which are the elements in a but not in b this means we should not have any element that is present in b so it will be thisand four is the only element present there mathematically it is written as a minus b minus b since we are not considering any elements from B the next one is interesting which are the elements in the universal set but not in a or b it will be the reason I am shading nowwe have shared that region that does not have a single element from A or B so 3 and 6 are the only such elements mathematically this is written as a union b the whole complement this means all elements in Universal set accept the ones in a union b
