we look at just two simple sets in this video set P which has one two and three as its elements and set Q which has 1 24 and 5 as its elements understand the elements well this has 1 2 and 3 and this one has 1 2 3 4 and 5 This is a part of this and that's why we say set P is a part of set q and we learnt in the previous video that part of also means subsetso we can say that set P is a subset of set you do we have a symbol to represent this yes it's written like this p is a subset of Q the letter you is sleeping on this line so when is P A subset of you set P is a subset of set Q when every elementis also present in queue look at the elements every element in p is also present in queue but this statement is a new query look at Set C and D Set C has 45 and 6 as its elements and set D has 46 and 5 as its elements both the sets havesame elements which makes them equal but every element in Set C is also present inside D based on the definition we can say that Set C is a subset of set D this also tells us something more it tells us that every set is a subset of itself P is a subset of p q is a subset of qand so on for some reason this is not seem entirely correct and that give rise to a new concept of proper subset look at sets P and Q set P is a part of set q but there is at least one element in set Q which is not present in set P we say that set P is a proper subset of set qsign indicates proper subset and this tells us that all elements of P are present in set q but there is at least one element in queue which is not present in p we can see that 4 and 5 are not present in p so that's the concept of a proper subset sometimes it is also referred to as the strict subsetcan we say sea is a proper subset of D think about it that would be incorrect since there is no element in D which is not a part of C that has to be at least one such element that's the only difference between a subset and a proper subset Just One last thing we need to understand just as we say p is a
